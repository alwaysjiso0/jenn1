  <h2> Jennifer OPIc 단기완성! </h2>
  <p style="margin-bottom:40px">Hello, everyone. This is Jennifer from <strong><u>Jennifer</u> OPIc</strong>. I will be guiding your steps to gain your objective score for the OPIc test. Trust me, and trust in yourself. Let's get started!</p>
  <img src="beach.jpg" width="100%"><p style="margin-top:40px"><a href="https://www.opic.or.kr/opics/jsp/senior/index.jsp" target="_blank" title="opic webpage">The OPIc</a> is an internet-delivered test which provides valid and reliable oral proficiency testing on a large scale. It was developed in response to the increased worldwide demand for the testing of oral language proficiency.</p>
  <p>The internet-delivered assessment emulates the "live" OPI, but delivery of questions is through a carefully designed program and via a virtual avatar, allowing the test to be taken on demand and at a time convenient to the candidate and proctor.</p>
